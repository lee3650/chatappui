## Things to handle better in this project

- [ ] async code - I want spinners, animations, etc when things are loading, and better error handling
- [ ] handling backend responses in TypeScript - using interfaces, not using `@ts-ignore`, etc. 
- [ ] frontend / backend planning, and making sure they work together nicely
